# Fashion-MNIST Refund Classifier

## Part 1: Train

1. Download the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist/data)
2. Unzip and place `fashion-mnist_train.csv` and `fashion-mnist_test.csv` into `model_data/`
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the training script:

```bash
python3 model/train.py
```

The trained model is saved to `saved_model/model.pkl`.

## Part 2: API

Run the API:

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

---

## Part 3: Samples and Prediction

Get a sample and send it to the API:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — start the API
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2 — send a sample to /predict
python3 get_sample.py | curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @-
```

`get_sample.py` returns a JSON object with a `pixels` array of 784 integers (28×28 pixel values, range 0–255) representing one flattened Fashion-MNIST image.

---

## Part 4: Docker

> Make sure you have run `python3 model/train.py` first — the API container requires `saved_model/model.pkl` at build time.

Start all services (API + batch + PostgreSQL):

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Drop CSV files into `batch_process/upload/` — they will be processed once per day (ex: at 02:00)

---

## Training

`model/train.py`:

- Reads CSVs from `model_data/`
- Separates labels from pixel columns
- Normalizes pixel values (divides by 255)
- Trains a `RandomForestClassifier` on 60k images
- Evaluates accuracy on 10k test images
- Saves the model to `saved_model/model.pkl` using `joblib`

When the API starts, it loads the model once into memory:

```python
model = joblib.load(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "saved_model", "model.pkl"))
```

---

## Batching

`batch_process/batch.py`:

- Looks in `upload/` for CSV files
- For each file, sends each row to `POST /predict` with the pixel data as JSON
- Saves results to PostgreSQL (`predictions` table)
- Runs automatically every night at 02:00 via the scheduler

To test manually, add a CSV to the upload folder:

```bash
cp model_data/fashion-mnist_test.csv batch_process/upload/
```

## Predictions Table

| column | type | example |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | auto-increment integer | 1, 2, 3... |
| `source_file` | text | `returns_batch_1.csv` |
| `row_index` | integer | 0, 1, 2... |
| `predicted_class` | integer | 9 |
| `predicted_label` | text | `Ankle boot` |
| `confidence` | float | 0.87 |
| `processed_at` | timestamp | `2026-04-20 02:00:00` |

---

## Dataset

`fashion-mnist_train.csv` contains 60,000 rows. Each row is a clothing image flattened to 784 pixel values (28×28 grayscale), plus a `label` column.

| label | class |
|---|---|
| 0 | T-shirt/top |
| 1 | Trouser |
| 2 | Pullover |
| 3 | Dress |
| 4 | Coat |
| 5 | Sandal |
| 6 | Shirt |
| 7 | Sneaker |
| 8 | Bag |
| 9 | Ankle boot |

The dataset does not contain refund data — it is used only to train the image classifier.

## Real-world Flow

1. A customer returns an item — staff photograph it
2. The photo is converted to pixel values and saved as a CSV in `batch_process/upload/`
3. Every night, the batch job calls `/predict` for each row
4. Predictions are stored in the `predictions` table in PostgreSQL

## How to Run

### Option A — Local

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Train the model
python3 model/train.py

# 3. Start the API
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# 4. Test with a sample (in a second terminal)
python3 get_sample.py | curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @-

# 5. Run the batch manually
python3 batch_process/batch.py
```

### Option B — Render (cloud deployment)

The app is live at: https://refund-item-image-classification-system.onrender.com

To deploy your own instance:

1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → **New → Blueprint**
3. Connect your GitHub repository — Render detects `render.yaml` and creates 3 services automatically:
   - **fashion-classifier-api** — Web Service (FastAPI)
   - **fashion-classifier-batch** — Cron Job (nightly at 02:00)
   - **refund-db** — PostgreSQL database
4. The build step trains the model automatically — no manual pre-training needed
5. After the API deploys, copy its public URL and set the environment variable on the batch service:
   - Go to **fashion-classifier-batch → Environment**
   - Add `API_URL = https://<your-api-url>/predict`
6. To trigger the batch job manually: **fashion-classifier-batch → Logs → Trigger Run**

---

### Option C — Docker (local)

```bash
# 1. Train the model (required before building)
python3 model/train.py

# 2. Start all services — API, batch scheduler, and PostgreSQL
docker-compose up --build

# API is available at http://localhost:8000
# Batch scheduler runs nightly at 02:00

# 3. Drop CSV files into the upload folder to be processed
cp model_data/fashion-mnist_test.csv batch_process/upload/
```
